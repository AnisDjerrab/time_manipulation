# Time Manipulation
This is a small Python program where I learned how to manipulate time in Python.  
It provides five main functionalities :  
1. Print the current time.  
2. Act as a chronometer.  
3. Calculate the time elapsed.  
4. Calculate the difference between two dates.  
5. Calculate the difference between a given date and today.  
Thanks for giving it a try !
